# Succinct Bug Bounty Program

## Overview

This bug bounty program is specifically for [Telepathy](https://github.com/succinctlabs/telepathy-contracts)’s smart contract and circuit code.

Our bug bounty security guidelines are based on [Immunefi’s vulnerability severity classification system](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/), and are subject to change at any time.

The bug bounty program is administered by Succinct. All bug bounty decisions made are final. An Immunefi-based bug bounty program is coming soon.
